# wsl_arch_setup

This is a script that sets up Arch Linux WSL with the configuration I want.

Currently is has the following functions:
- Installing lots of commonly used packages
- Updating .bashrc with commands etc.
- Generating a ssh key for github
- Setting up neovim config

The neovim config can be found here: https://github.com/Skarkii/neovim_repo

Make sure to run :PackerSync in neovim to install all packages.
